  		README for L4/MIPS

Prequisites before building

1) You need mips-sgi-irix6 cross-compiler development tools.
	
2) A running version of GNU make, from here on referred to as make.



Now, to build the Downloadable Image Tool (DIT)

1) First set edit src/Makefile.conf as appropriate. In particular you
   will need to set the following according to your local environment:

    - TOP to the (absolute) path name of the directory of this README
      file;
    - TOOLBIN to the directory where tool binaries (which are to run on
      the development host) are to be installed;
    - INSTALL to the directory where L4/MIPS is to be installed (i.e.,
      the include files, libraries and kernel images);
    - TARGET_MACH to one of the supported machines;
    - XDEVBIN to where your cross development tools are installed;
    - HOST_BAUD to one of the baudrates;
    - BOOT to the directory used for booting;
    - KERNELNAME to the name under which the kernel image containing
      device drivers will be installed in $(INSTALL)/kernel.

   Some other variables may need defining if your enviroment has some
   unusual conventions (check MAKEWHATIS, MAKEWHATISFLAGS).


   The following are to be executed from $(TOP)/src:

2) Run "make depend" to build dependencies.

3) Run "make tools" to build dit.

4) Run "make tools-install" to install it in $(TOOLBIN)

Now to build L4/MIPS, serial driver and the libraries

1) run "make all"

2) run "make install"

You now have a bootable image (in $(INSTALL)/kernel/kernel-serial)
containing the kernel and serial driver, and a little example set up
ready for building in $(INSTALL)/example. See the docs for more info on
doing further development.

Kernel developers may find the programs in $(TOP)/src/kernel/test useful.

Good luck!
