.TH L4_MIPS_IPC_CHIEF_WAIT 2 "16.12.98" "CSE/UNSW" "System calls"
.SH NAME
l4_mips_ipc_chief_wait \- chief wait for message from any source
.SH "Synopsis"
.br
\fB#include <ipc.h>\fP
.PP
\fBstatic inline int\fP 
.br
\fBl4_mips_ipc_chief_wait(l4_threadid_t\fP \fI*src\fP \fB, 
l4_threadid_t\fP \fI*real_dst\fP \fB, void\fP
\fI*rcv_msg\fP \fB, l4_ipc_reg_msg_t\fP \fI*rcv_reg\fP \fB,
l4_timeout_t\fP \fItimeout\fP \fB, l4_msgdope_t\fP \fI*result\fP
\fB);\fP
.SH "Description"
The call waits for any message and returns via \fI*real_dst\fP the its
intended destination. This is different from the caller's id if the
received message was redirected.
.SH "Arguments"
.IP "\fI*src\fP"
Thread id of the source (undefined if no message was received).
.IP "\fI*real_dst\fP"
The thread to which the received message was directed by its sender.
.IP "\fI*rcv_msg\fP" 
Pointer to Receive Descriptor. It can contain the
following values: 
.RS
.IP "\fB0\fP"
Only messages up to 8 dwords and are
accepted. The received message is stored in \fIrcv_msg\fP.
.IP "<mem>" 
If Bit 1 of \fI*rcv_msg\fP is 0 ipc includes receiving a
message (or waiting to receive a message). \fI*rcv_msg\fP must
point to a valid message. Note that the first 8 dwords of the 
received message are stored in \fIrcv_reg\fP.
.IP "<rmap>"
If Bit 1 of \fI*rcv_msg\fP is 1 only send\-fpage messages or up to 8
dwords (in \fIrcv_reg\fP) are accepted. If a map message is received,
the 62 most significant bits describe the receive fpage (instead of
\fIrcvfpage option\fP in a memory message buffer). Thus fpages can also
be received without a message buffer in memory.
.RE
.IP "\fI*rcv_reg\fP" 
A pointer to the place to store the first 8 dwords received in registers of received message,
undefined if no message was received. 
.IP "\fItimeout\fP"
This 32\-bit word specifies all 4 timeouts, the
quadruple (snd, rcv, snd pf, rcv pf). For a detailed description see
the L4 Reference Manual.
.IP "\fIresult\fP"
The message dope describing the result of the Ipc.
.SH "Return Values"
The following return values are possible:
.IP "\fB0\fP"
No error occured. The optional send operation was
successful, and if a receive operation was also specified, a message
was also received correctly. 
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_ENOT_EXISTENT\fP"
Non\-existing destination or source.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_RETIMEOUT\fP"
Timeout during receive operation.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_RECANCELED\fP"
Receive operation cancelled by another thread.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_REMAPFAILED\fP"
Map failed due to a shortage of page
tables during receive operation.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_RESNDPFTO\fP"
Send pagefault timeout.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_RERCVPFTO\fP"
Receive pagefault timeout.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_REABORTED\fP"
Receive operation aborted by another
thread.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_REMSGCUT\fP"
Received message cut. Potential reasons
are:
.RS
.IP "(a)"
The recipient's mword buffer is too small.
.IP "(b)"
The recipient does not accept enough strings.
.IP "(c)"
At least one of the recipient's string buffers is too small.
