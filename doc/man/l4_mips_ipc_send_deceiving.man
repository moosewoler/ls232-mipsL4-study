.SH NAME
l4_mips_ipc_send_deceiving \- deceive send operation
.SH "Synopsis"
.br
\fB#include <l4/ipc.h>\fP
.PP
\fBstatic inline int\fP 
.br
\fBl4_mips_ipc_send_deceiving(l4_threadid_t\fP \fIdest\fP \fB,
l4_threadid_t\fP \fIvsend\fP \fB, const void\fP \fI*snd_msg\fP \fB,
l4_ipc_reg_msg_t\fP \fI*snd_reg\fP \fB, l4_timeout_t\fP \fItimeout\fP
\fB, l4_msgdope_t\fP \fI*result\fP \fB);\fP
.SH "Description"
A chief can specify a virtual sender id in \fIvsend\fP which the
recipient should get instead of the chief's id. Recall that deceiving
is secure since only direction\-preserving deceit is possible. If the
specified virtual sender id does not fulfill this constraint, the call
works like \fBl4_mips_ipc_send()\fP.
.SH "Arguments"
.IP "\fIdest\fP"
Thread id of the destination.
.IP "\fIvsend\fP"
Virtual sender id for the destination.
.IP "\fI*snd_msg\fP"
Pointer to a Send Descriptor. It can contain the 
following values:
.RS
.IP "<mem>" 
Ipc includes sending a message to the destination 
specified by \fIdest\fP. \fI*snd_msg\fP must point to a valid
message. The first 8 dwords of the message have to be given 
separately by the pointer \fI*snd_reg\fP.
.IP "\fB0\fP" 
Ipc includes sending a message to the destination specified by
\fIdest\fP. The message consists solely of the 8 dwords pointed to by
\fI*snd_reg\fP.
.RE
.IP "\fI*snd_reg\fP"
A pointer to the first 8 dwords to be transmitted in registers.
.IP "\fItimeout\fP"
This 32\-bit word specifies all 4 timeouts, the
quadruple (snd, rcv, snd pf, rcv pf). For a detailed description see
the L4 Reference Manual.
.IP "\fIresult\fP"
The message dope describing the result of the Ipc.
.SH "Return Values"
The following return values are possible:
.IP "\fB0\fP"
No error occured. The optional send operation was
successful, and if a receive operation was also specified, a message
was also received correctly. 
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_ENOT_EXISTENT\fP"
Non\-existing destination or source.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SETIMEOUT\fP"
Timeout during send operation.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SECANCELED\fP"
Send operation cancelled by another thread.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SEMAPFAILED\fP"
Map failed due to a shortage of page
tables during send operation.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SESNDPFTO\fP"
Send pagefault timeout.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SERCVPFTO\fP"
Receive pagefault timeout.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SEABORTED\fP"
Send operation aborted by another thread.
.IP "\fBL4_IPC_SEMSGCUT\fP"
Received message cut. Potential reasons
are:
.RS
.IP "(a)"
The recipient's mword buffer is too small.
.IP "(b)"
The recipient does not accept enough strings.
.IP "(c)"
At least one of the recipient's string buffers is too small.
