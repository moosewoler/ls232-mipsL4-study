                      CITE.STY

 Modify LaTeX's normal citation mechanism to:

 o Sort citation numbers into ascending order; print non-numbers before
   numbers.  Compress lists of three or more consecutive numbers to one
   number range which can be split, with difficulty, after the dash.
   All numbers should be greater than zero.
   E.g., if you used to get [7,5,6,?,4,9,8,Einstein,6], then this style
   will give you [?,Einstein,4-6,6-9].

 o Allow, but strongly discourage, line breaks within a series of
   citations.  Each number is separated by a comma and a small space.
   A break at the beginning of an optional note is discouraged also.

 o Always put an interword space before the citation and allow a
   highpenalty break there (unless you specifically forbid it with ~).
   E.g.,   Something really stupid \cite{Larry,Curly,Moe}.
                                  ^-- This space doesn't matter.

 o Ignore spaces after the commas in the parameter list.

 o define \citen to get just the numbers (and write to the aux file)
   without the brackets and extra formatting.

 o `Citation...undefined' warnings are only given once per undefined
   citation tag.  In the text, missing numbers are represented with a
   bold `?' at the first occurrence, and with a normal `?' thenceforth.

 Linebreaks are allowed with triple-highpenalties after dashes
 and commas; these may have to be taken if TeX sees no other
 viable breakpoints.  If you think citations are being split
 unnecessarily, try using \sloppy or a sloppypar environment.

 Although each \cite command sorts its numbers, better compression
 into ranges can usually be achieved by carefully selecting the order
 of the \bibitem entries, or the order of initial citations when using
 bibtex.  Having the entries presorted will also save processing time,
 especially for long lists of numbers.

 Customization:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 There are several commands that you may redefine (using \renewcommand)
 to change the formatting of citation lists:

  command       function                   default
 ----------    -----------------------    ----------------------------
 \citeform     reformats every entry      nothing
 \citepunct    printed between numbers    comma + penalty + thin space
 \citeleft     left delimiter of list     [
 \citeright    right delimeter of list    ]
 \citemid      printed before note        comma + space

 Under LaTeX2e, there are three options for \usepackage{cite}:
 [verbose] causes warnings for undefined citations to be repeated each
           time they are used.
 [nospace] eliminates the spaces after commas in the number list.
 [space] uses a full inter-word space with no penalty after the commas

 Some examples:
 \renewcommand\citeform[1]{\romannumeral 0#1}} % roman numerals [i,vi]
 \renewcommand\citeform[1]{(#1)} % parenthesized numbers [(1)-(5)]
 \renewcommand\citeform {\thechapter.}  % by chapter: [2.18-2.21]
 \renewcommand\citepunct{,} % no space and no breaks at commas
 \renewcommand\citemid{; }  % semicolon before optional note
 \renewcommand\citeleft{(}  % parentheses around list
 \renewcommand\citeright{)} % parentheses around list

 The appearance of the whole citation list is governed by \@cite, so
 for more extensive changes to the formatting, redefine \@cite.

 Related Note:  cite.sty does not affect the numbering format of
 the bibliography; the "[12]" style is still the default.  To change
 that format (at any time) you can redefine \@biblabel, including
    \renewcommand\@biblabel[1]{#1.}
 in your personal style file, or with, for example,
    \makeatletter \renewcommand\@biblabel[1]{(#1)} \makeatother
 directly in your document.  If these do not work, your LaTeX and/or
 document style are very outdated.

 \@extra@b@citeb is a hook for other style files to further specify
 citations; for example, to number by chapter (see chapterbib.sty).

 See also overcite.sty and drftcite.sty for superscript and draft
 (draught) mode citations.

 ROBUST!

% Version 1989: Original.
% Version 1991: Ignore spaces after commas in the parameter list. Move most of
% \citen into \@cmpresscites for speed.
% Version 1992: Use \citepunct for commas so it is easier to change.
%
% Version 3.0 (1992):  Rewrite, including sorting.  Make entries like "4th"
% be treated properly as text.
% 3.1: bug fixes (Joerg-Martin Schwarz also convinced me to use \ifcat)
% 3.2: Supress repetitions of warning messages. Include \@extra@b@citeb hook.
% 3.3: handle LaTeX2e options. Introduce various customization hooks.
%
% Send problem reports to asnd@Reg.triumf.ca
%
% test integrity:
% brackets:  round, square, curly, angle:   () [] {} <>
% backslash, slash, vertical, at, dollar, and: \ / | @ $ &
% hat, grave, acute (apostrophe), quote, tilde, under:   ^ ` ' " ~ _
