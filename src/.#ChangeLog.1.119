Mon Dec  8 10:45:25 1997  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@cse.unsw.edu.au>

	* tagged the lot as L4_69

	* Lots of changes since last time, general overview is:- 

	Merged the gpt only page table code from simulator back into the
 	L4 kernel tree and got it running. Did lots of benchmarking etc
 	for various n-ary GPT trees. In detail :-

	* Added src/include/kernel/gt64010a.h a header file for the
	gt64010.
	
	* Added src/kernel/drivers/clock.c, a program to receiver and
	count precise interrupts from the gt64010.

	* Added src/kernel/u4600/dlr1414.s, routines to print to LED from
	C. 

	* src/tools/dit/append_data.c: Changed dit to store real file
	sizes rather than the rounded file sizes.

	* src/tmp/gpt_sim/vm/lookup.ms: Added intrumentation to tlb refill
	handler. It is included if TLB_INSTR is def'd

	* src/tmp/gpt_sim/vm/gpt.h: Added whole bunch of new support
	GPTROOTSIZE and GPTSIZE combinations.

	Fixed up a few function prototypes, though some cleaning up is
	still needed.

	* src/tmp/gpt_sim/vm/gpt.c: Added a ugly hack to allow gpt insert
 	to be passed tcb or gpt pointers. Needed as vm_tcb_insert does not
 	always have access to a tcb pointer.

	Added some intrumention code that is active if TLB_INSTR is
	def'd. 

	Fixed a bug in tree parsing code. Changed  an 8-bit index to a
	16-bit index as values were out of range if GPTSIZE was 8.

	gpt_print was modified to print out tree statistics for 

	* src/tmp/gpt_sim/vm/as.ms: Added code to handle more
	GPTROOTSIZEs. 

	Added the pop_pos, push_pos code here for stack position in tree.

	* src/kernel/u4600/boot.s: Changed reset_serial_io (called by
	panic) from being stub to actually doing the reset if it's def'd
	in.

	* src/kernel/tlb.ms: Fixed a potential ASID corruption bug in
	tlb_sync.

	tlb_sync_shared modified to simply 'shoot down' entries, rather
	than bothering to search and load new potentially new entries.

	* src/kernel/startup.ms: Added code to initialise TLB
	instrumentation variables and initialise the GT_TICKer if
	required. 

	* src/kernel/sigma0.c: Changed a kludge required for rounding
	physical addresses to work for memeory sizes not powers of 2.

	* src/kernel/panic.s: Added code to get compare regeister for
	debugger.

	Removed code to push and pop page table 'position' on the
	stack. It has moved into the vm specific code.

	* src/kernel/macros.m4: Added code to tcb init code to  initialise
	page table intsrumentation variables.

	* src/kernel/ipc.c: Added some more tracing for kernel debugging.

	* src/kernel/interrupts.ms: Added code to do precise tick
	interrupts from a gt64010 timer on u4600 board. defining GT_TICK
	selects this timing mode, otherwise the internal R4700 timer is
	used using the adaptive tick length.

	* src/kernel/exc.ms: Cleaned up an 'END()', added some more
	tracing.

	* src/kernel/debugger.c: Added printing of the co-processor
	compare register to observe the adaptive timer value.

	Added code to print out various TLB and page table instrumention
	values.
	

	* src/include/kernel/u4600.h: Added symbolic descriptions of
	interrupt identifiers.

	* src/include/kernel/kernel.h: Added some page table profiling
	entries in the task control blocks.

	The adaptive timer has been tuned a little more, ie it starts
	closer to the observed equilibrium point.

	Added TLB profiling entries to the kernel data. 


Fri Oct 31 13:50:13 1997  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@cse.unsw.edu.au>

	* Worked on a new gpt only page table setup inside simulator:- 


	- moved old gpt-cached code to vm-tlbcache-gpt directory, and new gpt
	code is in vm directory.

	- modified simulator to test some new features of vm interface and
	new vm code seems to work. Code is done except for vm_print_fpage.

	pte. In kernel space, blocks are initialised with the shared
	invalid tcb.

	- Above results is being faster generally as gpt_lookup_ptr adds
 	most new mappings, not gpt_insert which parses tree much slower.

	* fixed a bug in ex_reg for thread id 1.

Sun Feb 23 12:43:58 1997  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@moench.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Tagged L4_32

	* Wrote a timestamp routine for the Indy that supercedes the slow
	old c equivalent.

	* Added support for dumping ranges of memory in the debugger.

	* Added primitive support for n32 compiled clients. Hacked dit to
	support their addition to downloadabel images.

	* Added some primitive profiling code that uses the last megabyte
	to store addresses.

Sat Feb 15 14:18:15 1997  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Tagged as L4_31.

	* Changed dit to round the link address to below 128M so as
	drivers appear to run from 0-64M ram (ie unchanged).

	* Added indy specific drivers for time (using i8254) and serial
	port (using z85230).

	* Did port to Indy!!! Lots of little changes including

	- kernel.h: New memory layout as physical memory is not at zero on
	Indy, it starts at 128M

	- exc.ms: removed P400i specific debuging code
	
	- interrupts.ms: ifdef'd p4000i specific interrupt handling, and
	now panic if other previously unused interrupts actually happen.

	- macros.m4: renamed ifdef in m4 so ifdef in CPP works.

	- sigma0.c: lots of little changes to cope with new physical
 	memory layout. It actually hides it from drivers etc so normal
 	code runs as before. NOTE: Does not handle > 128M ram.
	
	- startup.ms: ifdef's p4000i specific stuff, hardwired ram to be
	64M, appropriate interrupts now enabled and ifdef'd. 

	- syscalls.ms: also enables and ifdefs appropropriate interrupts.

	* Tagged L4_30

	* Fixed a bug with the second tcb in a page pair not being
	intialised properly which resulted in ex_reg not working for odd
	tcbs. Both tcbs in a page are now initialised sesnsibly on
	allocation.
	

Thu Jan 30 11:46:31 1997  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* tagged lot as L4_29

	* fixed tlb2_sync_shared to check both buckets in cache.

	* Fixed a major bug. Page fault protocol was incorrect, w/r were
	indicated randomly, ie incorrectly.

	* added new kernel vars to debugger print out.

	* cleaned up kernel.h as the C struct was out of date with
	assembler offsets.

	* Suprisingly it all seems to work (with my test suite). Tagged as
	L4_28

	* New tlb2.ms 
	
	- New TLB refill routine that uses a software TLB cache (128k,
 	two-way assoc).

	- Miss routine for software tlb cache load "page pairs" for
	effecient loading of tlb2 and TLB.

	- sync routines added to ensure consistency in both TLB and tlb2
	after changes are made to gpt's. Handles both per process pte and
	shared tcb pte.

	* Merged the simulator code into the kernel which wasn't as simple
	as it sounds. Gory, potentially out of order, details follow.

	- In gptdefs: changed the structs defining both gpt nodes and
 	mapping trees. put in the new protoypes for gpt functions and tlb2
	functions.

	- In kernel.h: changed the memory layout to reserve space for
 	TLB2. Created some extra save registers for both TLB exceptions
 	and entering the kernel.

	- In kmem.h: Added prototypes for new mapping tree memory
	management routines.

	- In types.h: Add some convenient bitmasks for RW and GRANT.

	- In debugger.c: Modified gpt printer to use new gpt tree layout.

	- In exc.ms: Changed kernel entry routine for cope with TLB refill
 	on entry. Previously it would double or triple fault until clean
	entry.

	- In exc.ms: Modified tlb exception handling to handle both read
	and write faults correctly. It's now much shorter as it doesn't
	try an initial refill "for luck" anymore.

	- In gpt.c: Major changes here. All functions changed, some simple
 	cleaned up with minor changes (gpt_insert,gpt_remove,gpt_init),
	others virtually redone to use new gpt and map tree layout
	(gpt_map, gpt_fpage_unmap).

	- In kmem.c: New mapping tree memory management code added. Gpt
	code cleaned up.

	- In sigma0.c: pt_insert modified to use new gpt layout.

	- In syscalls.ms: TLB manipulation code removed, now handle more
	consistently elsewhere (tlb2.ms).

	- In tcb.c: tcb allocator modified to use the new gpt layout and
	ensure second in page pair has GLOBAL bit set.


Fri Jan 24 16:06:36 1997  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@dingo.orchestra.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* tagged and L4_27

	* Used simulator to build and test a TLB cache. Came up with a new
 	gpt parser which is 2 cycles slower, but will load pairs for the
 	mips TLB.

	* Revived the simulator in tmp to get ro/rw pages working.

	* Fixed a bug in IPC path due to over zealous optimising on my
	part, IPC slowed to 91 cycles. Could get this back with really
	ugly optimisation, but will leave it for now.

Sat Jan 18 15:22:55 1997  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@moench.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Tagged L4_26

	* Tuned the IPC path again directly rather than as a separate
	file. Got *** 90 cycles *** for IPC which is actually better than
	previous incorrect result.

Fri Jan 17 16:36:39 1997  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@moench.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Tagged as L4_25

	* fixed send base and send fpage to be in correct order in
	registers.

	* fixed a bug in page fault ipc which corrupted the PC of the
	faulting instruction.

Wed Jan 15 13:37:55 1997  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@moench.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Tagged as L4_24

	* Fixed nasty bug to do with interrupts disabled in kernel. Tlb
 	exceptions are higher priority than interrupts and the situation
 	arises that we can page fault on code with an invalid pager and we
 	endless loop with interrupts disabled. Page fault ipc is now
	delivered with interrupts enabled.

	* Tagged as L4_23

	* Added a hand optimised version of exc.ms for speed testing. Got
	*** 86 *** cycles for IPC.

	* Added a real ipc timing tester to the test.

	* Added reboot to debugger.

	* Fixed a bug in round robin scheduling code.

	* Finally fixed the "Address Error Load" bug. Added a tlb
 	exerciser to the tests to reproduce it..

	* Removed general exception redirect so that general exception
	handler now runs in place for better performance.

	* re-arranged kernel variable and tcb variable layout to be cache
	friendly for much improved IPC performance.

Thu Dec 19 14:32:21 1996  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Fixed a big in ipc library that was corrupting messages on the
	user side.

	* Modified TLB refill to use it's own "save" registers as it was
	corrupting the general exception handler.

	* Modified dit to be able to add executables to the kernel image
	without the kernel actually running them.

	* modified the header files for l4 syscalls, types, and ipc as
	MIPS C compiler allocates bit strings in the opposite direction to
	the PC.

Wed Dec 11 11:47:31 1996  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* tagged as L4_22

	* Changed proto type for ex reg to be compatible with pc version.
	

Fri Dec  6 14:32:07 1996  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Tagged as L4_21

	* Changed exception return routine again. I must be hitting a
	co-processor hazard in some manner, though the docs indicate I'm
	okay in the regard?? New routine works so far.

	* Wrote a new syscall interface library to match new header files.

	* Modified sigma0 to use less stack. 

	* Added support for using the 32 bit format timeouts, rather than
	my previous linear timeouts.

	* Merged the dresden l4 C header files into my source tree and
	modified both them and my code to use them.

Fri Nov 29 10:30:08 1996  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Tagged as L4_20.

	* Wrote first attempt at lthread_ex_regs. Seems to work.

	* Fixed a bug in thread id generationin create task.

	* Added make busy macro to start threads in various states for
	ex_regs.

	* Added comm partner to tcb to allow easier break off of IPC.

	* Fixed a bug in exception and syscall return that cause an
	interrupt to interrupt the exception return which corrupted the
	stack. 

	* Added trace macro to print out string to LED display from inside
	kernel.

	* Added ability to print a few more c0 registers in debugger

Fri Nov 22 16:32:27 1996  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* tagged as L4_19

	* page faults to non-existent task control blocks are caught and
 	panic-ed on.

	* Hacked tlb general exception handling to potentially act as a
 	refill handler for debugging purposes.

	* Finally found the true cause of the semi-random address
	exception errors. Would you believe a missing nop in the tlb
	refill routine!!

Thu Nov 21 10:15:18 1996  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Tagged as L4_18

	* We have virtual task control blocks!!! Uses a single shared
	branch of the gpt tree and the "global" bit in the TLB for
	efficient TLB refill.

	Did this by

	- shuffling the memory layout to be more efficient (see kernel.h).
	
	- moving tcb space from physical space to kernel virtual.
	
	- changing create thread and startup appropriately.
	
	- keeping an array of chief/version numbers for each task so as to
	be able to recycle tcbs.
	

Sun Nov 17 14:13:54 1996  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* tagged the whole thing as L4_17

	* Added the beginnings of assert. it currently simply causes a
	trap exception.

	* fixed a nasty bug in sigma0 to do with device mapping that was
	causing semi-random problems/crashes.

	* Added lots more debugger features
	
	- runs on special stack area
 	
	- now has "break" style ability to stop and restart via call to
	dbg from just about anywhere in kernel.

	- can now print out gpt trees for debugging purposes
	

	* Added code to support specifying thread id in task create.

Thu Nov 14 19:34:24 1996  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Tagged the whole thing as L4_16

	* Added extra coded to serial exerciser threads to test sonic
	timestamper as well,

	* Added extra features to debugger to dump tlb contents and
	various c0 registers.

	* Add a driver for the sonic ethernet chip for timing purposes
	only at this stage.

	* Changed dit to include names of files in downloadable image.

Wed Oct  9 17:16:45 1996  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* tagged the whole thing as L4_15

	* we use real, per task, ASIDs now.

	* wrote a loader that starts sigma0 and then all extra task images
	appended to kernel in downloaded image.

	* don't have kernel printf tracing now serial i/o done at user
	level. 

	* fixed a bug in debugger to stop it from deriving the wrong tcb
	base now we have a user level sp.
	
	* add device mapping to sigma0 and wrote a user level serial port
	device that simply prints messages it receives prefixed by the
	senders thread id.

	* modified task_create to accept user level sp, ip, and pager.

	* made a user level libc using libkern...may clean up lib kern at
	some stage as these are similar.

	* Modified sigma0 to "reserve" pages for downloaded images, and
 	added new kernel function frame_reserve which does a similar
 	thing.

	* Wrote a tool called dit that can :-

	- build a 32 bit object file from a 64 bit one to allow kernel
	download (also adds an extra program segment for a header page)

	- query a 32 bit image to find the next link address for cascading
	devices driver images to run with sigma0 as pager

	- append a driver image that is linked at correct address internal
 	to the last program segment, including correctly allocating space
 	in the segment for bss etc.

	- dump the header section to see whats been appended to the
	initial kernel.

	The tool seem to function okay for now.

	* Lots of changes yet again including USER LEVEL TASKS!!!!!

Fri Sep 27 10:14:12 1996  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* tagged everything as L4_14

	* pretty major additions since last time:- 

	- fixed a bug in "long" exception return.

	- Modified create thread to create a gpt with new threads.

	- Ported frame table table memory management to board including
 	ugly hack to cope with race condition with sigma0.

	- added code to do mapping ipc to "long" ipc path which then calls
 	the C code from the simulator.

	- Modified the debugger to print out various new variables both in
	the kernel and TCBs.
	
	- Wrote a real sigma0 that receives page faults and sends mapping
 	ipc to client

	- Wrote a tlb refill handler and a tlb exception handler. tlb
 	exception handler sends a page fault ipc to pager if page
 	"invalid".

Fri Sep 13 13:00:23 1996  Kevin John Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Tagged whole thing as L4_13.

	* in the tmp directory, wrote gpt_map routines that maps a
 	flexpage from one gpt to another. The above routine also generates
 	mapping trees to allow fpage unmaps to happen semi-efficiently.

 	Wrote a fpage unmap routine that use mapping trees to unmap gpts
 	in derived address spaces.

 	wrote a memory allocator for mapping trees.

 	Wrote a simulator that - 

	- builds up a hierachy of simulated address spaces, each with own
 	gpt and frame table to double check.
  	
	- probes address spaces causing "maps" from parent address spaces,
 	which propogate up to sigma0. Double checked from local address
 	space frame table.

	- generates unmap calls that invalidate current page and all child
 	address space pages. Double checked using per address space frame
 	table.

 	Fixed bad bug in frame table allocator.


	* Added TLB initialisation to boot.s

	* Added sizemem function to libkern.

Thu Aug  1 15:34:01 1996  Kevin Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Added test_threads3.c to test the pending case again and fixed a
	bug or two I found. Note: ipc_sleep is a receive_from waiting for
	thread ID -1 not zero which now signifies an open wait. Tagged
	whole thing as L4_12.

	* Wrote a new C ipc library (ipc.ms) to do various scenarious of
	ipc and only actually 8 dword messages to be sent. Tested it with
	the re-written test_threads.

Wed Jul 31 11:00:20 1996  Kevin Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Added test_threads2.c which has three concurrent threads sending
	to a busy thread and timing out. The kernel crashed at first but
	has been fixed now. Tagged as L4_11

Thu Jul 11 15:01:02 1996  Kevin Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau.disy.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Debugged all the changes to the stage that the previous (L4_9)
 	testing threads now work reliably. Tagged this version as L4_10.

	* Kernel now uses real thread IDs with version numbers. However,
	since I haven't implemented 'kill', this is not very well tested
	as everthing has a version number of 1 :-)

	* Added a simple debugger and changed the panic routine to jump to
 	the debugger. Debugger allows printing memory, kernel variables,
 	registers, TCBs and thats about all. Added a few extra routines to
 	libkern needed by the debugger.

	* The code to handle pending IPC is there now (untested) and three
 	level wake up list handling is also been added and seems to work.

	* Lots of major changes since last version. Decided to use m4 as a
	macro processor for the assembler. Most assembler files now use
	macros defined in macros.m4 as shorthand.

	Re-wrote most of the IPC code to something fairly close to what
 	will be the final version. Has most things in place to handle
 	everthing, though some things may only be tested for and not
 	handled yet (eg long ipc, deceiting ipc, clans and
	chief). Basically the framework is there.

Wed Apr 17 11:31:46 1996  Kevin Elphinstone  <kevine@composer.orchestra.cse.unsw.EDU.AU>

	* Oops, stuffed the directory structure up, so version L4_8
 	actually doesn't build. I fixed the problem and tested it and
 	tagged it as L4_9.

	* Changed the test threads to also print the LED count via kprintf
	to test the stuff implemented below. It works!!! Tagged the whole
	thing as L4_8

	* Wrote a kprintf routine for kernel printing. It simply adds
	characters into a buffer. Thread 0 now monitors the buffer and does
	polled output on the serial port.

	* Grabbed the serial port driver from the pmon sources and did
	some really ugly hacking to get it to compile outside of pmon. It
	does polled I/O which should suffice for now.

	* Restructured the sources into more appropriate directories, as
	sources are beyond the doing everything in "tmp" stage.

Fri Mar 29 13:45:27 1996  Kevin Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau>

	* Added "auto" thread ID allocation to example below. Thread IDs
	are still not the proper L4 thread id though. Tagged as L4_7

Thu Mar 28 12:39:05 1996  Kevin Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau>

	* Wrote four threads that passed a token between each other, with
	one of them updating a LED counter. Ie send_receive, receive_only,
	send_only now work. Note: sending to busy thread kernel
	panics. Tagged as L4_6.

	* Wrote a receive_only ipc test thread that "sleeps" and times out
	on wait for message. Tagged as L4_5.

Wed Mar 27 13:29:23 1996  Kevin Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau>

	* Added libmipsL4.s, giving a C interface to system calls so test
	code can now be in C. Tested it by running a C version of test
	application used previously. Tagged L4_4.

	* Added thread switch system call. It take no args and switches to
	head of runq for remaining time slice. Thread zero (init) now
	simply loops calling this syscall. Tagged as L4_3

	* Wrote the basic IPC code. Does register transfers only, IPC
	timeouts, run and wakeup queue handling, no fpages, chiefs
	etc. Tested only by previous applications (ie no IPC tested, only
	create thread and id_myself to test runq handling). Tagged as L4_2

Mon Mar  4 13:51:45 1996  Kevin Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau>

	* Got system calls working and context switching. Built two simple
	system calls (create thread, id_myself) and created 4 threads
	which simply print their ID on the alphn display. Tagged the whole
	thing as L4_1

Thu Feb 22 13:58:43 1996  Kevin Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau>

	* Did a more complicated example of catching timer
	interrupts. Built a simple counting display using C and libkern
	etc. Tagged as TIMER_1

	* Set up handling of more than just the debug interrupt. Set up
	the count and compare register to do timer interrupts. Tagged it
	as TIMER.

Wed Feb 21 15:57:38 1996  Kevin Elphinstone  <kevine@jungfrau>

	* changed exception handling to stack and unstack registers to
	both catch and return from exceptions. Tagged as EXCPT_2

	* Oops, code fails to build cleanly. Fixed makefile and retagged
	as EXCPT_1

	* Current code is a simple exception catcher and printer. Code
	tagged as EXCPT

	* Added top down makefile system. To build, first make tools; make
	tools-install in irix5.3 environment. Then make all in cross64
	environment.
